# RecipeAppFinal

This is a simple 3-screen recipe app made in Kotlin using Android Studio.

## Screens

- **Home Screen**: Shows a scrollable grid of recipe images and names.
- **Details Screen**: Displays the selected recipe's image, ingredients, and steps.
- **Feedback Screen**: Lets the user rate the recipe with radio buttons, a checkbox for making it again, a comment field, and a submit button.

## Features

- Clean and scrollable layout
- Smooth navigation between screens
- Uses `Intent` to pass data
- Functional submit and toast messages
- Back button added to each screen

## Current Progress

✅ All screens are working  
✅ Interface is complete and ready for classmate testing  
✅ Recipe details and ingredients are hardcoded  
✅ Navigation and input components are working  

## Questions or Feedback Areas

- I’m happy with how it turned out, but I know there’s always more that could be added for a better user experience. For this stage though, I feel like I was able to complete everything I planned.

## Test It

Just open the app and scroll through the recipe list. You don’t need to enter anything to start.
